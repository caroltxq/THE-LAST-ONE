   Since the 20th century, the pollution of human living environment has become increasingly aggravated, the living environment has been deteriorating, people are in closer contact with carcinogenic factors, and the incidence of malignant tumors has been increasing year by year. Malignant tumors have become the biggest enemy of human health, surpassing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.  Cancer is the leading cause of death in both urban and rural China.  The morbidity and mortality rates of both men and women in China gradually increase with age.  At present, the situation of cancer prevention and control in China is still very grim, with about 3.1 million new cancer cases and 2.5 million deaths every year.  In the past 20 years, the incidence of cancer has been increasing year by year.  The incidence of cancer causes heavy economic burden and psychological trauma to the country, society and individuals.  For me, the 3D model building of tumor cells enables me to have a deeper understanding of the principle and specific process of tumor cell migration and diffusion. Meanwhile, it is an opportunity for me to improve my 3D modeling ability and understand the academic application of 3D modeling.
