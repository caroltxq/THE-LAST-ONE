Overview of the project£º
    Itraeonazole, also known as spirenol, is a third-generation triazole antifungal agent with strong antibacterial activity, a broad antibacterial spectrum, and few adverse reactions, especially for deep fungal infections.
    Itraconazole has recently been found to have antitumor activity to medulloblastoma, basal cell carcinoma, and prostate cancer.  But its exact mechanism remains elusive. To date, two anticancer mechanisms of itraconazole have been proposed, namely, inhibition of angiogenesis in some cancer cells and inhibition of Hedgehog signaling pathway.  Therefore itraconazole has great value for further development.  
    In the process of preclinical pharmacodynamics and safety evaluation, animal selection is very important for human safety prediction.  In the process of drug screening and new drug development, the metabolism, efficacy and toxicity of a candidate compound are usually studied in animals first, and then its metabolism in humans can be predicted. In vitro metabolic model can be used to screen the species differences of itraconazole at an early stage, and provide research ideas for the causes of species differences in humans and rats. 
    What we aim to do in the project is to verify the difference and explore the mechanism and features.
    So we used both in-vivo experiment and molecular mimicry software in this project. Firstly, the metabolic differences of ITZ-C (2S,4R,2's) and OH-ITZ (C) in human and rat liver microsomes were determined by LC-MS/MS analysis. Since itraeonazole has 4 isomers, we investigated the metabolic stability of A, B, C and D isomers in human liver microsomes at 50,500 nmol/L in vitro. The measure was the quantity of metabolites. High concentration of itraconazole had strong autoinhibitory effect on microsomal metabolism, while low concentration had weak inhibitory effect.  Then we did the same experiment in rat liver microsomes. The trend was opposite and it proves the existence of difference.
    In addition, the amount of hydroxyl metabolites produced by the four isomers was different from the amount of degradation of the original drug, suggesting that other metabolites might be formed.  
    Based on the finding, we suggested that it may related to its binding to CYP3A4. So we used Discovery Studio to study the binding of CYP3A4 of itraconazole in liver microsomes of rats and humans respectively.  On the basis of theoretical analysis, the possible binding sites on itraconazole were screened by organic synthesis.  The binding site was labeled 1,2,3,4......  By reserving only 1 or 2 or 3 or......  Synthesis of several different itraconazole derivatives.  The binding sites of CYP3A4 and itraconazole in rats can be obtained by processing the experimental data. The same method was used to treat human liver microsomes.
