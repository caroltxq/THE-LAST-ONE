project overview
 
   Since the 1970s, transdermal drug Delivery system (TDDS), mainly in the form of patches, has gradually become a research and development hotspot due to its stable blood drug concentration, no first pass effect, gastrointestinal irritation, ease of use and safety.  
However, due to the barrier effect of the skin, it is highly selective for the development of transdermal drug delivery formulations of existing drugs. Most of the drugs are difficult to penetrate the cuticle of the skin to reach the concentration required for treatment, making the research and development of such preparations into the bottleneck of more research and fewer products.  As the biggest barrier of transdermal drugs, how to make drugs, especially macromolecules, enter the skin quickly through the cuticle has become the focus of research. With the progress of micro-nano processing technology, the development of microneedles and their lattice for transdermal drugs is particularly rapid.  
   Psoriasis, commonly known as "psoriasis", is a common recurrent inflammatory skin disease, which is characterized by clear red scaly patches of varying sizes, covered with a large number of dry silver-white scales, accompanied by itching of varying severity. In addition, due to the change of appearance, the quality of life of patients has a serious impact.  There is no specific treatment, but it is not incurable.  Appropriate symptomatic treatment can control symptoms.  Because psoriasis is a chronic recurrent disease, many patients need long-term treatment, and various therapies have certain adverse reactions.  
The pretreatment of skin with macromolecule microne can form micropores and increase the percutaneous permeability of drugs, which plays a good role in promoting the treatment of psoriasis.  In particular, the development of psoriasis treatment has introduced some biological drugs such as anti-inflammatory factor antibodies.  When administered locally, it is difficult to cross the cuticle due to its physicochemical properties.  The introduction of microneedles can effectively solve this problem and achieve the purpose of local administration and targeted administration.  
   The shape of the microneedle can affect its properties, hardness, and drug delivery characteristics. Long-term administration or biological responsiveness requires long-term adherence of microneedles to the skin. The traditional microneedle shape has low tissue adhesion and is not conducive to long-term administration. Change shape to improve adhesion.   So we developed a bionic microneedle imitating the shape of hair and it can load Methotrexate.
   The cephalic cortex is made up of many overlapping tiny scales (also known as hairy scales) and acts as a protective layer.  Scales intact, smooth, margin neat and undamaged. Scales arched or damaged when hair is damaged.  
   We can use this barb shape and the scale arching under certain conditions to prepare bionic microneedles and improve their adhesion.  When the tissue fluid is not contacted, the scaly structure is in a closed state. After absorbing the tissue fluid, due to the good water absorption of the material, the scale expands rapidly, increasing the contact surface. At the same time, the rough surface of the structure enables the prepared microneedle array to adhere to the skin well, even in the state of motion can maintain a long time of adhesion. Make soluble microneedles without pulling them out to increase patient compliance. Due to its strong adhesion, it can be designed to peel off the backing layer directly after pasting, which is more convenient for patients.
